			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Hello, world. My name is Yura Kim, I was born in New York City then moved to Delaware at age 8. There I attended a magnet middle and high school for the arts then moved on to attend the Delaware College of Art and Design. Throughout my year at DCAD, I felt unfulfilled. so I made a life altering decision to change my major to software engineering and transfer to the Rochester Institute of Technology.</p>
			<p>Art and design had been all that I'd known for years â€“ I came to RIT knowing nothing about programming and little about computers. I have always had a passion for technology and problem solving, so I knew I would thrive here and I was right. I struggled through my first computer science course, but I quickly caught up to my peers. Now, I find myself missing design so I have taken a special interest in user experience.</p>
			<p>My vision of the future is a world where every device in our lives are connected through the internet of things. Aesthetically pleasing human-centered designs will make our lives easier and more intuitive. I am facinated by this vision and I would like to contribute to it in any way possible.</p>
